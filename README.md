# ArimaModel
Predicting gas prices using an ARIMA model. 

This notebook examines and predicts gas prices in the United States, the dataset used in this notebook was provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (Jan 2021) through Mau Ruanovau's Kaggle profile. Data from 2005 through January 2021 is examined. Much of the python code used in this notebook was derived from an article by Jason Brownlee that may be accessed at https://machinelearningmastery.com/arima-for-time-series-forecasting-with-python.

The model predicts that the price of regular gas will rise in February and March before falling through July 2021.
